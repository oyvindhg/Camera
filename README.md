# Specialization project - Part 2: Object Detection

**Description:** This is the code that consitutes the second part of my report from my specialization project during my penultimate semester of the Cybernetics and Robotics study program.

**Contect:** In order for a robotic manipulator to observe its environment (in my master's thesis), it will be equipped with a camera that will act as its perception module. The second part of this project therefore involved processing of camera images. Firstly, camera calibration was performed in order to remove distortion from the images. Secondly, object detection was performed on these undistorted images.
